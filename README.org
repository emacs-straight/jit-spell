jit-spell is a spell-checking package for Emacs.  It highlights all
misspelled words in a window, just like a word processor or web
browser does.

This behavior is different from the built-in Flyspell package, which
only checks words as the cursor moves over them.  Moreover, unlike
Flyspell, jit-spell communicates with the spell-checking subprocess
entirely asynchronously, which can lead to a noticeable performance
improvement.

jit-spell is part of [[https://elpa.gnu.org][GNU ELPA]] and can be installed with
=M-x package-install RET jit-spell RET=.

** Usage

To enable spell checking in a buffer, type =M-x jit-spell-mode RET=.
To correct a misspelling, you can right-click the word (assuming you
have =context-menu-mode= activated) or call the command
=jit-spell-correct-word=, which uses the minibuffer to read a
correction or accept the word.

To make your settings permanent, you may wish to add some variant of
the following to your init file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'jit-spell-mode)
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'jit-spell-mode)
(with-eval-after-load 'jit-spell
  (define-key jit-spell-mode-map (kbd "C-;") 'jit-spell-correct-word))
#+end_src

To pick a spell checker and dictionaries, jit-spell uses Emacs's
built-in ispell support code.  Try =M-x customize-group ispell RET=
to see a listing of all possible settings.

** Major mode support

Some major modes require special settings to avoid checking irrelevant
parts of the buffer.

The simplest mechanism to achieve that is the user option
=jit-spell-ignored-faces=.  Any word fontified with one of these faces
is ignored for spell-checking purposes.  To find out which faces are
present on a given character, you can use =M-x describe-char=.

In all programming language modes, spell checking is restricted to
comments, docstring and strings.  This can be modified by customizing
the variable =jit-spell-prog-mode-faces=.

Some modes, such as Org and TeX-related modes, require more extensive
adaptations.  This is not yet provided as I am evaluating the possible
approaches.
